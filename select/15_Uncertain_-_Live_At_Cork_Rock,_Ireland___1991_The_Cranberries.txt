Tears on your face honey,
You're a total disgrace
Oh why, oh why did you bring me here?
Start all over again, honey
You still treat me the same
Oh why, oh why did you bring me here?
You have everything I could ever want
Won't you tell me why, the panic and the fears
So uncertain in love
You're so uncertain in love
So uncertain...
Driving in the car, honey
You mistook me by far
Oh why, oh why did you bring me here?
Leaves in the wind, honey
You had nothing to send
Oh why, oh why did you bring me here?
So uncertain in love
You're so uncertain in love
So uncertain...
