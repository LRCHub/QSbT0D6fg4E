Well this life that I live
Has took me everywhere
There ain't no place I ain't never gone
Well it's kind of like the sayin
That you heard so many times
"Well there just ain't no place like home"

Did you ever see a She-Gator
Protect her youngin?
Or fish in a river swimmin' free?
Did you ever see the beauty
Of the hills of Carolina?
Or the sweetness
Of the grass in Tennessee?

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
Cuz when I can seen the concrete
A slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

Do ya like to see a mountain stream a flowin?
Do ya like to see a youngin with his dog?
Did ya ever stop and think about
Well, the air your breathing?
Well ya better listen to my song

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
Cuz when I can see the concrete
A slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

I'm not tryin to put down no big city
But the things they write about us is just a bore
You can take a boy out of ole' Dixieland
Lord, but you'll never take ole' Dixie from a boy

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
Cuz when I can see the concrete
A slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

Cuz I can see the concrete
A slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes.
